❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
- ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to an error because `a` and
`b` are undefined.
- ❌ The function doesn't take any arguments, which limits its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
